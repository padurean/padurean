I am [Valentin Padurean](https://purecore.ro) (nicknamed "Ogg") from Brasov, Romania.

- Since mid-October 2021 I am currently working as a [Go](https://golang.org) developer (backend) for an online system which allows end users to book appointments at a car repair workshop.
- Before this I worked as a [Go](https://golang.org) develper on these projects:
  - [x] [immudb](https://github.com/codenotary/immudb) - a lightweight, high-speed immutable database for systems and applications
  - [x] [CodeNotary Immutable LedgersÂ®](https://codenotary.com) - an easy to use tamperproof ledger with cryptographic verification, processing millions of transactions a second on-premise or in the cloud
- For my other (older) work experience, please check [my LinkedIn profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/vpadure) :)
